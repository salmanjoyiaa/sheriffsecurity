IMPORTANT: Save the commando photo as "commando.jpg" in this directory (public/)

The photo should be:
- Named exactly: commando.jpg
- Professional headshot with transparent or white background
- High resolution (at least 800x800 pixels recommended)
- JPG format

The code has been updated to use /commando.jpg as the source.
Once you save the image with the correct name, it will automatically display on the website.
